### Installer Recipes

Simplify the installation and setup of SAP Commerce for *development* purposes. Do not use the installer to run one recipe after another on the same SAP Commerce setup. The installer does not uninstall recipes, and does not restore your SAP Commerce file system to its original settings. To install another recipe, use the original SAP Commerce files and directories.

Follow the next steps to Run a fresh SAP Commerce using a recipe:

```
cd installer; ./install.sh -r platform_only setup
cd installer; ./install.sh -r platform_only initialize 
cd hybris/bin/platform; ./hybrisserver.sh start
```

### Extensions
An extension is an encapsulated piece of SAP Commerce functionality, that can contain business logic, type definitions, a web application, and back-office configuration functionality. Depending on your business needs, your solution will have a varying number of extensions, all wired into the core SAP Commerce platform via the Spring dependency injection model.

SAP Commerce ships with a number of extension templates, and an ant-based tool (called extgen) for generating new extensions based upon these templates. In this and subsequent sections, you extend SAP Commerce by adding and developing your own custom extension.
