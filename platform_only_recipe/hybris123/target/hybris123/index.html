	In the Explore SAP Commerce tour, you use the core features of SAP Commerce to create a website for a fictitious company called the Little Concert Company. The goal is to meet the realistic but fictitious business demands of the Little Concert Company. The Little Concert Company sells tickets for an eclectic assortment of small, independent concert tours. Each tour consists of a number of concerts performed at a small set of locations throughout Europe. Tickets are currently sold by phone, but the company now wants to add this capability to its website by replacing the old, bespoke website and manual back-office booking process with a modern, Hybris-based commerce system.
